<h1>The Best Movies According to Israel</h1>
<h2>My Top Movies of 2023</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
<p>This was a monumental movie and one that will be remembered and studied for a very long time. It was an impeccable cinematic experience. Christopher Nolan made a masterpiece all round and a mi=ovie that keeps you thinking even after leaving the theater. Cillian Murphy gave the best male acting performance of the year where you could see the internal conflict in the character of oppenheimer. Ludwig Goransson's score was phenomenal all round with my favourite tracks being Can you hear the music, Groves and Meeting kitty. Christopher nolan crafted a sublime screenplay from a very lengthy book which held my attention throughout the three hours duration of the movie. Coupled with the sound design, editing, production design and casting every unit in the production gave it their undenying best.</p>
<h3>Poor Things</h3>
<p>This was a beautiful movie outlining the struggles of a dysfunctional girl/woman in the world of evil men.</p>
<h3>Holdovers</h3>
<p>This was an heartfelt mirroring the christmas movies of the 70s/80s. It shows the relationship of a strict and antisocial teacher, his neglected student and a sorrowful mother.</p>
<h3>Barbie</h3>
<p>This was a brilliat movie abaout the barbieland and the strength and critisms of modern day feminism</p>
